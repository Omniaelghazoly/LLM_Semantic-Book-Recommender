This project develops a semantic book recommender system leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).
It allows users to input a book description and receive recommendations for similar books, classified by categories and emotional tones.

Project Components

- **Text Data Cleaning**: Preparing raw text data for effective use in LLMs.  
- **Semantic Search with Vector Database**: Using embeddings & ChromaDB for book similarity search.  
- **Zero-Shot Classification**: Categorizing books without labeled data.  
- **Emotion & Sentiment Analysis**: Extracting emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, etc.  
- **Interactive Dashboard with Gradio**: A creative and user-friendly web interface.
